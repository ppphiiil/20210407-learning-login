## Test your form for speed
Form speed is often a neglected consideration during testing. Consider the following metrics:

- Time it takes the system to load and display the form initially
- Time it takes the user to complete the form
- How actual completion time relates to user expectations
- Time it takes the system to process the form and display a completion state or message
