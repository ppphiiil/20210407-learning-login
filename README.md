![form example](readmefiles/form.png)

## What makes a Form userfriendly?
- See which form is active
- Place labels above form elements, not to the left of them
- Arrange lists, checkboxes, and radio buttons vertically
- if you reload the page, your input is saved in Local Storage
- enought distance between inputs
- Use a stepped or multi-screen format for long forms
- If you do use optional fields, clearly mark them
- interactive button
- keyboard usability, (tab) Make your form usable without a mouse
- validation
- correct autocomplete="tel" / autocomplete="one-time-code" /browser auto-fill
- inputtype and right inputmdode for showing the right keyboard
- Optimize the order of your form fields
- Use a one-column layout
- Label fields clearly and concisely
- Show extra infos: Address users’ concerns in the place they will arise
- Consider using the first-person on buttons "create my account"
- Always show label helper text
- Responsive Webdesign
- Use success states
- Allow copy and paste
- On mobile, don’t auto-hide password entry
- Allow users to resize fields themselves where appropriate
- Use a sans-serif typeface with a high x-height
- Auto-save form data
- Test and optimize your form for all major browsers and devices
### Valitation
- Use inline validation in preference to submit validation
- Wherever possible, the system should correct format errors itself
- Use inline validation to confirm user progress
- Ensure that error messages help the user to fix the error
- Disable the “Next” or “Submit” button until validation is passed

## Test your form for speed
Form speed is often a neglected consideration during testing. Consider the following metrics:

- Time it takes the system to load and display the form initially
- Time it takes the user to complete the form
- How actual completion time relates to user expectations
- Time it takes the system to process the form and display a completion state or message
